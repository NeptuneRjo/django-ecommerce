## Reflection

This was a project built with the goal of learning Django-Rest-Framework, FramerJS, and improving my ReactJS skills.

I wanted to build a fullstack ecommerce web application that exercised backend principles like CRUD and REST with new a technology.
CRUD functionality felt like a good place to start, and learning how Django handles things like authorization and DB management helped me grow as a backend developer.

There were a few challenges with this project, or atleast new things to practice. Python3 and Django are completely new to me, and this is my first project with both. On the frontend, I used an animation framework Framer-Motion, which I've never used before. I also took the time to develop my css skills, creating a rudementary design system for easier styling.

The tools implemented in this project are:

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, React-Router-Dom, Cypress.io, Jest, and Framer-Motion
- Backend: Django, Django-Rest-Framework, SQLite, Python3
